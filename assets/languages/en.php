                      <p>We need the data mentioned in order to be able to offer basic functions. Without saving the data, our bot would 
                         not be functional, so we cannot refrain from saving it. For example, for reaction roles, our blocking system, 
                         bans and many other functions, we rely on the storage of data.

                      <b style='color: #D48166'>Where do we store the data and who has access to it?</b><br>
                      <p>We use a MongoDB database to store everything related to data. We store less relevant data that is automatically deleted 
                         after a certain period of time (including all AFK data) in JSON files. Neither our MongoDB database nor our JSON files can be 
                         accessed externally. Only one person has access to our server, which is protected against unauthorized access with maximum security.
