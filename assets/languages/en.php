                                After many bots and many setbacks, we decided to start from scratch for once - Nevar is the result.
                                Our goal is to offer the most important functions from all areas free of charge",

                      <p>We need the data mentioned in order to be able to offer basic functions. Without saving the data, our bot would 
                         not be functional, so we cannot refrain from saving it. For example, for reaction roles, our blocking system, 
                         bans and many other functions, we rely on the storage of data.
                      </p><br>
                      <b style='color: #D48166'>Where do we store the data and who has access to it?</b><br>
                      <p>We use a MongoDB database to store everything related to data. We store less relevant data that is automatically deleted 
                         after a certain period of time (including all AFK data) in JSON files. Neither our MongoDB database nor our JSON files can be 
                         accessed externally. Only one person has access to our server, which is protected against unauthorized access with maximum security.

                      <b style='color: #D48166'>Can I delete my data??</b><br>
                      <p>Yes, you can have some of your data deleted by us.<br>
                         <li><b>AFK data:</b> These are automatically managed and deleted by the bot, so there is no provision for manual deletion.<br></li>
                         <li><b>Server data:</b> In order to reset all data on a server, the server owner can send us a corresponding request so that we can carry out the deletion.<br></li>
                         <li><b>Moderation data:</b> We do not delete this data because it contains essential data (including temporary bans).<br></li>
                         <li><b>Log data:</b> We save the use of any commands, this data is only used to collect usage statistics of our bot and to understand certain events.

                        <p>To have your data deleted by us, an informal message on our <a href='/support'>support server</a> or by email to <a href='mailto:legal@nevar.eu'> 
                           is sufficient legal@nevar.eu</a>. This should include your Discord ID, username, and what exactly you want us to delete from you.
