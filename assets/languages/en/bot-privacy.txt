<b style='color: #D48166'>Why do we store data and what do we use it for?</b><br>
<p>We need the aforementioned data to be able to offer basic functions. Without the storage of the data, our bot would not be
       functional, so we cannot refrain from storing it. For example, for reaction roles, our blocking system, bans
       and many other functions, we are dependent on the storage of data.
</p>
<br>
<b style='color: #D48166'>Where do we store the data and who has access to it?</b><br>
<p>We use a MongoDB database to store everything that concerns data. Less relevant data that is automatically deleted after a certain
       (e.g. all AFK data), we store in JSON files. Neither our MongoDB database nor our JSON files can be accessed externally.
       Only one person has access to our server, which is protected with maximum security against unauthorised access.
</p>
<br>
<b style='color: #D48166'>Can I delete my data?</b><br>
<p>Yes, you can have some of your data deleted by us.<br>
<li><b>Server data:</b> All server-based data can be deleted<br></li>
<li><b>User data:</b> Except for the AFK data (which is automatically deleted), all user data can be deleted<br></li>
<li><b>Member data:</b> Except for data regarding bans and mutes, all member data can be deleted<br></li>
<li><b>Log data:</b> We store the use of any commands, this data is only used to collect usage statistics of our bot and to track certain events.
                         They are not intended for deletion.</p>
</li>
<br>
<b style='color: #D48166'>How can I delete my data?</b><br>
<p>You can delete your data yourself without much effort in a few seconds: the /delete-data command brings up a menu where you can delete your user/member/server data.
</p>
<br>
<b style='color: #D48166'>Where do I contact if I have concerns or questions about my data?</b><br>
